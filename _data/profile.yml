    Hi there! My name is Tingyao Wang, in simplified Chinese: 王廷曜.
    I'm a Master's student in <a href="https://quantum.engineering.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Quantum Science and Technology</a> at Columbia University (one of 14 in our very first cohort, yay!).
    Back in June 2024, I graduated from Zhejiang University with a B.E. in Computer Science and Technology.
    
  </p>
  <p>
    I began my journey in QUANTUM with Professor <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/xinwan" target="_blank">Xin Wan</a>'s course on Fundamentals of Quantum Information at ZJU.
    Later on in the first half of my senior year, I was very privileged and fortunate to work with Professor <a href="https://www.tongyangli.com/" target="_blank">Tongyang Li</a> at Peking University, mainly focus on Quantum Optimization.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I continue my studies at Columbia University, I'm motivated to expand my technical stack in the quantum realm. 
    I want to develop a comprehensive understanding that spans from the fundamental theory of quantum mechanics to the more abstract computational layers, such as qubit engineering and quantum error correction, and further towards the design of higher-level optimization applications. 
    Currently, I'm working with Professor <a href="https://xueyue-sherry-zhang.github.io/" target="_blank">Sherry Zhang</a> in <a href="https://zhang.apam.columbia.edu/index.html" target="_blank">PhoQIS Lab</a> at Columbia University.
